Overview
========

xmodels is a Python library to convert XML documents and Python dictionaries
including collections.OrderedDict to and from instances of Python data
structures and validate them against a schema.
The conversions between XML and Python dict/collections.OrderedDict are
performed by `xmltodict <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmltodict>`_.
It supports XML specific schema features like ordered sets of element type
**<xsd:sequence>**, selection from a set of element type
**<xsd:choice>** and namespaces.


.. doctest::

    >>> from xmodels import Model
    >>> print('pass')
    pass


Some common use cases:

+ Design and document specific `data structures <https://schematics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage/models.html>`_
+ `Convert structures <https://schematics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage/exporting.html#converting-data>`_ to and from different formats such as JSON or MsgPack
+ `Validate <https://schematics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage/validation.html>`_ API inputs
+ `Remove fields based on access rights <https://schematics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage/exporting.html>`_ of some data's recipient
+ Define message formats for communications protocols, like an RPC
+ Custom `persistence layers <https://schematics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage/models.html#model-configuration>`_


Examples
--------

This is a simple Model.

::

  >>> from schematics.models import Model
  >>> from schematics.types import StringType, URLType
  >>> class Person(Model):
  ...     name = StringType(required=True)
  ...     website = URLType()
  ...
  >>> person = Person({'name': u'Joe Strummer', 
  ...                  'website': 'http://soundcloud.com/joestrummer'})
  >>> person.name
  u'Joe Strummer'

Serializing the data to JSON.

::

  >>> import json
  >>> json.dumps(person.to_primitive())
  {"name": "Joe Strummer", "website": "http://soundcloud.com/joestrummer"}

Let's try validating without a name value, since it's required.

::

  >>> person = Person()
  >>> person.website = 'http://www.amontobin.com/'
  >>> person.validate()
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "schematics/models.py", line 231, in validate
      raise ModelValidationError(e.messages)
  schematics.exceptions.ModelValidationError: {'name': [u'This field is required.']}

Add the field and validation passes

::

  >>> person = Person()
  >>> person.name = 'Amon Tobin'
  >>> person.website = 'http://www.amontobin.com/'
  >>> person.validate()
  >>> 

What's with the fork?
=====================

At the top of this projects Github page is says "forked from
exfm/dictshield".  James (@j2labs) started dictshield while working
for exfm.  It was open sourced, so he forked it and continued work on
it.

Alas, the name, which was originally a 3am decision to make me James
laugh turned into something that was awkward and a little crude, so it
was renamed Schematics.

DictShield still exists, but consider anything with that label to be
a ghost from this project's early years.

Testing & Coverage support
==========================
Run coverage and check the missing statements.

::

  $ `coverage run --source schematics -m py.test && coverage report`
